               <br>
               <p> New Delhi is India's capital and is one of the most widely known cities of the country. 
                  It is mostly famous for its rich and unique heritage and culture. 
                  There are several unique and beautiful monuments present in Delhi.
                   Delhi is considered as one of the most important historical places.
                   Founded by Emperor Shah Jahan and surrounded by a magnificent 18m-high wall, 
                   this fort took 10 years to construct (1638–48) and is rumoured to have had the 
                   decapitated bodies of prisoners built into the foundations for luck. 
                   It once overlooked the Yamuna River, which has now shrunk to some distance away. </p>
                   <p> A tree-lined waterway, known as nahr-i-bihisht (river of paradise), 
                   once ran out of the fort and along Chandni Chowk, fed by the Yamuna.
                   Looking a little like the famous Arc de Triomphe in Paris, 
                   the equally impressive India Gate is a magnificent stone arch built as a memorial to Indian soldiers killed in WWI. 
                   An eternal flame burns beneath the massive structure, and its walls are inscribed with the names of more than 90,000 soldiers who died in the conflict.
                   The city traces its history to Mahabharata, the great epic tale of wars fought between estranged cousins, 
                   the Kauravas and the Pandavas for the city of Indraprastha. Historically, the city has long since been the foremost in political importance with successive dynasties choosing it as their seat of power, 
                   between the 13th and the 17th centuries. Old Delhi was founded by Mughal rulers who ruled the city in succession starting from Qutab-ub-din to Khiljis, 
                   Tughlaqs each, under a different name given to the city. this fast developing region.</p>

               <h2> *** GOA  *** </h2>
               <br>
               <p> Goa is the smallest state in western India with coastlines of the Arabian Sea.
                   On 30th May 1987, Goa was declared as a state of India. 
                   Goa’s capital is Panaji City; its world-class beaches, food, 
                  and friendly people are the attractions of Goa.
                  Old Goa, on the island of Goa, was once the hub of the region, 
                  but the city was decimated by war and disease in the 18th century; for the most part, 
                  only its ruins remain. Since the mid-20th century, however, efforts have been made to preserve Old Goa.
                   Among the city’s most notable landmarks are the Basilica of Bom Jesus, 
                   which enshrines the tomb of St. Francis Xavier, and the Se Cathedral, dedicated to St. Catherine of Alexandria. 
                   Both were built in the 16th century, and, with several other churches of Goa,
                   they were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986.</p>
                   <p>The sandy coast of Goa is perfect for reclining by the sea. 
                   Nestle into a cushioned chair at a beach shack and savor a curry while you sip a Kingfisher beer, 
                   watching the sun slip lazily below the horizon.
                   In Old Goa, the beautiful Basilica of Bom Jesus is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a fine example of baroque architecture.
                   Visit during Christmastime to experience a fantastic religious and cultural mash-up of East and West.
                   Goa is an Indian state but the people of Goa are often completely different compared to any other part of the country.
                    ... This is because Goan customs and culture is highly influenced by western culture,
                    all thanks to four hundred and fifty years of Portuguese rule that made Goa different from the rest of India.

               <h2> ***  AGRA *** </h2>
               <br>
               <p> Agra is a city in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India. 
                  The city is famous for being the capital of the Mughal emperors from 1526 to 1658.
                   It is a major tourist destination for its many Mughal-era buildings such as Taj Mahal,
                    Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all three of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
                    The Taj Mahal, is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra.</p>
                     <P>It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal;
                      it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare complex,
                       which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
                        Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. 
                        The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, 
                        which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees. The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor,
                         Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". </p>

               <h2> *** AMRITSAR *** </h2>
               <br>
               <p> Amritsar is a city in the northwestern Indian state of Punjab,
                   28 kilometers from the border with Pakistan. At the center of its walled old town, 
                   the gilded Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) is the holiest gurdwara (religious complex) of the Sikh religion.
                    It’s at the end of a causeway, surrounded by the sacred Amrit Sarovar tank (lake), Amritsar, 
                    literally a Pool of Nectar, derives its name from Amrit Sarovar, the holy tank that surrounds the splendid Golden Temple. 
                    Guru Ramdas, the fourth Guru of the Sikh faith, founded Amritsar in 1579. He constructed a pool on land gifted by the Mughal Emperor Akbar and called it Amritsar. </p>
                   <p>One of the most pristine cities with Guru-vaani humming from the Gurudwaras, Amritsar is renowned world over for the Golden Temple, also known as Harmandir Sahib Gurudwara - the holiest Gurdwara. 
                    It’s at the end of a causeway, surrounded by the sacred Amrit Sarovar tank (lake), where pilgrims bathe. This place is also famous for its Jallianwala Bagh massacre and its proximity to Wagah Border.
                     The Amritsari cuisine is also very famous. The satiating food and generous dollops of legendary Punjabi hospitality further connive to cast a spell upon the visitor. One of the most agriculturally productive cities of India, 
                    Amritsar is well connected with most of the important cities of India.
                    During the partition of the Indian Subcontinent in 1947, the Punjab region was divided between India and Pakistan near Amritsar. 
                    Pakistan wanted to annex Amritsar due to its close proximity with Lahore and 50% Muslim population; however, the city remained inside Indian territory. 
                    Similarly, India wanted to annex Lahore. Both of the cities experienced some of the worst communal riots during the partition. Mass evacuations were made both in Amritsar and in Lahore. 
                    Hence, the demographics of both the cities were changed following the partition, significantly altering the culture and affecting the political,
                     economic and social environment of the cities.
